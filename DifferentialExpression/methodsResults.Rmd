## Differential Expression 

## Methods

To perform differential expression analysis, we conducted two steps; estimate the relative abundance of transcripts, and apply statistical models to
test for differential expression between treatment groups. To estimate the relative abundance, we determine the numbers NGS reads match a given gene
within a genome. To accomplish, we utilized three packages Salmon, DESeq2, and tximport. 



## Results

```{R}
library(knitr)
de_anno <- read.csv("deAnnotated.csv", header= T)
kable(de_anno)
```
